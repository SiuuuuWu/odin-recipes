        <li>1 ts kosher salt</li>

        <li>1 ts minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions</li>
        <li>11/2 cups cooked rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, sake, rice vinegar, and brown rice in a bowl and whisk well until sugar is dissolved.<br>
            Stir in sesame seeds and crushed red pepper and set aside. </li>
        <li>Heat oils in a large skillet over high heat.<br> 
            Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly over chicken.<br> 
            Add chicken in a single layer to the skillet and cook, undisturbed until chicken is browned and releases
            easily from the pan, 4 to 6 minutes.<br> 
            Flip chicken pieces, cook 1 more minute and remove from pan; set aside. </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add ginger and garlic.<br> 
            Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.<br> 
            Reserve 2 tablespoon of the green onions for garnish and add remaining green onions to the skillet.<br> 
            Cook for 1 minute. Add 1 cup reserved soy sauce mixture to the skillet and stir with a wooden spoon, 
            scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.<br>  
            Bring mixture to a boil and cook until sauce has reduced by about a third or until slightly thickened and glossy. </li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally,<br> 
            until sauce is thickened slightly and chicken is coated in the sauce and cooked through.<br>  
            Serve over rice and sprinkled with reserved green onions.</li>
    </ol>
